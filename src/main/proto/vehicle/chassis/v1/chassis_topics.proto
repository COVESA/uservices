// Tire pressure is pivotal for road safety and vehicle performance.
// Under-inflated tires can cause the tread to quickly wear down and bend in
// rotation. This increases the tire temperature and rolling resistance,
// which lowers vehicle's fuel economy.
// Over-inflated tires are prone to damage and lose traction as the tires
// get warped due to excessive air pressure. This decreases the
// tire's footprint on the road, which may lead to unexpected reaction
// when a vehicle passes over potholes.
