// Provides brake pedal related information.
// The brake pedal is the primary interface that driver uses to communicate
// their desire to decelerate or stop the vehicle. The pedal press is based
// on the amount of pedal travel and the pressure applied on the pedal.
// The mechatronics control system interprets the brake pedal press as a
// desired braking torque and actuates that torque via the hydraulic
// control system.
