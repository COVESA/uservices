// The gear state field indicates how the propulsion system is connected to the
// vehicle chassis.
//
// The key vehicle level gear states are: Park, Reverse, Neutral, and Drive.
//
// The Drive state could have additional substates such as Low (where greater
// propulsion system braking is provided) and Manual (where the driver can
// manually select gear ratio).
//
// The vehicle level gear state controls and coordinates the operation of all
// gearboxes within the vehicle. Some vehicles could have multiple independent
// gearboxes of different types within the vehicle.
//
// Each gearbox achieves the desired vehicle level gear state differently.
// For example, 'Reverse' may require switching to the reverse gear within a
// traditional multi-speed automatic transmission gearbox or by spinning
// a motor in the reverse direction without any gear changes.

    // In this state, the driver's intended direction of motion is backwards

    // the driver accelerator pedal produces backwards motion from the vehicle.

    // the propulsion system backwards).

    // wheel changes dynamically during driving. There may be multiple settings
    // that the driver can select in this forward driving configuration, such
